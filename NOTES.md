# NOTES
## What is AWS?
With cloud computing, companies do not have to manage and maintain their own hardware and data centers. Instead, companies like AWS own and maintain data centers and provide virtual data center technologies and services to companies and users over the internet. 

AWS provides cloud computing services. 

## AWS Global Infrastructure
Infrastructure, like data centers and networking connectivity, still exists as the foundation of every cloud application. 

## Interacting with AWS
1. The AWS Management Console

2. The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)

3. AWS SDKs
Developers commonly use AWS SDKs to integrate their application source code with AWS services. 

## Security and the AWS Shared Responsibility Model
### AWS responsibility
AWS is responsible for security of the cloud. 
- Protecting and securing AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and data centers, down to the phisical security of the buildings
- Managing the hardware, software, and networking components that run AWS services, such as the phisical servers, host operating systems, virtualization layers, and AWS networking components

### Customer responsibility
Customers are responsible for security in the cloud. 


## Protect the AWS Root User


## AWS Identity and Access Management
### IAM
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that helps you manage access to your AWS account and resources. It also provides a centralized view of who and what are allowed inside your AWS account (authentication), and who and what have permissions to use and work with your AWS resources (authorization).
